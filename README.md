# model_cuda

This program is the implementation of some traditional image processing methods on cuda and the inference of deep learning models on tensorrt. I build the program motion that you can know how to use the cuda program. I build some simple image processing with cuda and 

# TO DO

# Current Function

# Environment
GTX2070s / Ubuntu18.04 / cuda10.0 / cudnn9.6.5 / tensorrt10.0.0 / nvinfer9.0.0 / opencv3.4.

# Run
This program is building in Clion, so you can open the program with Clion and run program.
If you want to use make to run the program, you can refer to camkelist.txt.

# Program Struct
The program has three ways for image processing(opencv, cpu and gpu(cuda)).

# Tensorrt Model
The tensorrt flie is yolov5s model. if you want to get some objection, you can use the way of cuda.
